Creating a packet sniffer involves capturing raw network traffic. While Python provides libraries for this purpose,  ethical considerations and potential restrictions on capturing network traffic  mean some libraries may not be suitable on all systems. Here's an approach using scapy (remember to check library restrictions before use)

1. Install Scapy (if not already installed):
pip install scapy

2. Ethical Considerations:
Only capture traffic on your own network: Ensure you have permission to capture traffic on the network you're using.
Respect privacy: Avoid capturing traffic containing sensitive information.

3. Running the Program:
Make sure you have permission to capture traffic on the network interface.
Run the Python script (e.g., python packet_sniffer.py).


Explanation:

We import sniff from the Scapy library.
The handle_sniffed_packet function takes a captured packet as input.
It retrieves the protocol layer (packet.layer(IP).proto).
It extracts the source and destination IP addresses from the packet layer (packet[0].src and packet[0].dst).
We limit the output to avoid overwhelming the user with large packets.
If the AttributeError occurs (meaning the packet might not have an IP layer), we handle it by printing a message.

The main function:
Uses sniff to capture packets from the default interface (en0).
Replace "en0" with your specific interface name if needed.
Sets the prn parameter to the handle_sniffed_packet function to process each captured packet.
